                    <p>
                        I'm incredibly thankful for the opportunity to
                        contribute to the production of <em>Breachers</em> as a
                        game programmer at Triangle Factory.
                        It was a challenging but deeply rewarding experience,
                        collaborating with an amazing team to push the limits of
                        what mobile VR hardware could achieve.
                        Seeing <em>Breachers</em> become one of the most popular
                        shooters on the Meta Quest in 2023 was a proud moment
                        for all of us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A huge shoutout to the entire team for their relentless
                        dedication and talent that made this game the polished
                        experience it is.
                        It was an honor to be part of such an ambitious project.

                    <hr>
                    <p>I've mainly been focusing on <strong>audio
                            features</strong> and fixing bugs in <strong>game
                            development</strong>, with a lot of attention to
                        <strong>sound design</strong>, making sure the audio
                        works well, and solving any in-game audio issues. I've
                        also worked on improving <strong>gameplay
                            mechanics</strong> and addressing <strong>server
                            problems</strong> to make sure the game runs
                        smoothly for both players and servers. With plenty of
                        experience in <strong>Wwise</strong> and
                        <strong>Unity</strong>, I've been able to integrate
                        complex <strong>audio systems</strong> and add
                        high-quality <strong>sound effects</strong> that really
                        elevate the game experience.</p>

                    <h2>Key Areas I've Worked On</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Audio Implementation</h3>
                    <p>I've added and fine-tuned various <strong>sound
                            effects</strong>, like explosions, gunshots, player
                        actions, and special sounds (e.g., syringes and
                        defusers). My experience with <strong>Wwise</strong> and
                        <strong>Unity</strong> helps me integrate and manage
                        these complex <strong>audio systems</strong> so
                        everything sounds just right.</p>

                    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
                    <p>I've fixed various <strong>audio bugs</strong>, including
                        wrong sounds, audio delays, and null references to make
                        sure the game runs smoothly. I've also worked on solving
                        technical issues with <strong>sound triggers</strong>
                        and syncing audio properly using
                        <strong>Wwise</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Gameplay Features</h3>
                    <p>I've worked on <strong>sound mechanics</strong> tied to
                        <strong>gameplay</strong>, like tracking rewards in
                        competitive modes and adding immersion with sounds for
                        features like door blockers and drones. My work on
                        dynamic <strong>sound effects</strong> makes the game
                        feel more interactive for players.</p>

                    <h3>Multiplayer & Server</h3>
                    <p>I've worked on fixing issues with
                        <strong>matchmaking</strong>,
                        <strong>rejoining</strong>, <strong>server
                            crashes</strong>, and overall <strong>server
                            stability</strong> to enhance the multiplayer
                        experience. Additionally, I've made sure audio runs
                        smoothly during online matches, ensuring that players
                        have consistent and high-quality sound throughout their
                        sessions.</p>

                    <h3>UI/UX</h3>
                    <p>I've improved <strong>UI-related audio</strong>, like
                        <strong>button clicks</strong>, <strong>progression
                            sounds</strong>, and <strong>match-found
                            notifications</strong>, making sure players get the
                        right audio feedback during menus and in-game
                        interactions. This helps keep the gameplay flow
                        smooth.</p>

                    <h2>Strengths</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Audio & Sound Expertise</h3>
                    <p>I'm skilled at handling all things
                        <strong>audio</strong>â€”whether it's implementing
                        <strong>sound effects</strong>, syncing music, or
                        optimizing everything using <strong>Wwise</strong> and
                        <strong>Unity</strong>. My focus is on making sure the
                        audio is well-integrated and enhances the player
                        experience.</p>

                    <h3>Problem-Solving & Debugging</h3>
                    <p>I'm used to tracking down and fixing technical
                        <strong>audio issues</strong>, such as <strong>sound
                            triggers</strong> not working or audio syncing
                        incorrectly. My attention to detail and skills with
                        <strong>Wwise</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong> help
                        me quickly solve problems and optimize <strong>audio
                            systems</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Server & Multiplayer Optimization</h3>
                    <p>I've worked on improving <strong>server
                            stability</strong>, <strong>matchmaking</strong>,
                        and <strong>multiplayer functionality</strong> to ensure
                        smooth online gameplay. My background in
                        <strong>server-side work</strong> helps make multiplayer
                        experiences seamless.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                    <p>I specialize in making sure audio plays at the right time
                        and in the right way. This involves managing
                        <strong>sound events</strong> and
                        <strong>triggers</strong>, using <strong>Wwise</strong>
                        and <strong>Unity</strong> to integrate and optimize
                        <strong>audio</strong> across platforms.</p>
                    <hr>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>I focus on making sure audio is properly integrated and
                        works well in the game. With my experience in
                        <strong>Wwise</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong>, I can
                        optimize complex <strong>audio systems</strong> and fix
                        technical issues related to <strong>gameplay</strong>
                        and <strong>servers</strong>. My problem-solving skills
                        and attention to detail make me a great asset for teams
                        working on both the technical and gameplay aspects of
                        the game, helping improve the overall experience and
                        performance.</p>
