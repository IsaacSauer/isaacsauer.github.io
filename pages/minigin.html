						For my second year in the <b>DAE Howest</b> program, I worked on
						<b>Programming 4</b>, where I had to build a <b>Game Engine</b> and use it
						to create a game called <b>Qbert</b>.

					<h3>Game Engine Details & Design Choices</h3>

					<hr>
					<b>Command Pattern</b>
					<p>
						The Input System uses commands to trigger specific events. You can set
						this up by either overriding the "Command" and "Execute" functions, or by
						using "CommandFunc" and passing a function pointer (no parameters and void
						return type). If you want to pass parameters, you can bind them when
						creating the CommandFunc.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Flyweight Pattern</b>
					<p>
						The flyweight technique is used for managing resources like textures. When
						you request a Texture2D, you pass in the file path, and if it exists, you
						get the texture back. Internally, the system stores resources in a map
						with file paths as the keys. This ensures each resource is loaded only
						once, saving memory.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Observer Pattern</b>
					<p>
						If you need to listen to events from certain objects without direct calls,
						you can add a subject to them. You create an Observer class, define your
						event methods, and connect it with the Subject class. When you want to
						notify listeners, you call "notify" on the subject and pass in the
						observer's function. You can also bind additional parameters when needed.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Singleton</b>
					<p>
						I have two types of singletons: a normal one with a static stack
						allocation and another using a static smart pointer for heap allocation.
						This makes using singletons easier and prevents the need to manually free
						the instance.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>State Machine</b>
					<p>
						I implemented an object-oriented state machine. You create a class
						inheriting from "State" and implement functions like "Enter", "Exit",
						"HandleInput", "Update", and "FixedUpdate". After setting up your state
						machine, you create instances of your custom state classes and start the
						machine. In your componentâ€™s update methods, you call "HandleInput" and
						"Update" and in "FixedUpdate", call "FixedUpdate" from the current state.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Game Loop</b>
					<p>
						For the game loop, I used the "Play catch up" pattern, which helps with
						both physics (using Fixed Update) and regular frame updates (Update).
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Component System</b>
					<p>
						Each GameObject can have components attached to it, each with its own
						logic. This makes components modular, so you can use them across different
						objects while keeping them functional. The parent GameObject manages the
						component lifecycle (Initialize, LateInitialize, Start, Update,
						FixedUpdate).
						<br>
						"Initialize" and "LateInitialize" are only called once, while "Start" is
						called each time the object becomes active (e.g., switching scenes).
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Update Method</b>
					<p>
						Each scene holds a collection of GameObjects, which may have child
						GameObjects and components. Since the game loop calls "Update" and
						"FixedUpdate" in the SceneManager, it lets each component have its own
						dedicated "Update" and "FixedUpdate" methods.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Event Queue</b>
					<p>
						Right now, there's no standalone Event Queue. However, I use it in the
						SoundSystem. Audio processing can be CPU-intensive, so I handle it on a
						separate thread. When you request to play a sound, it creates a task and
						adds it to the queue. The audio thread checks for tasks and processes them
						when the queue has items.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Service Locator</b>
					<p>
						I used a Service Locator for sound system management. Currently, I use SDL
						for sound, but I wanted flexibility in case I want to switch to a
						different sound library. The Service Locator makes it easy to swap
						services without having to rewrite code that uses the sound system.
					</p>

					<hr>
					<b>Dirty Flag</b>
					<p>
						Lastly, I added the Dirty Flag pattern for optimization. Each GameObject
						only stores its local transform, so to get the world transform, I used to
						traverse up the hierarchy every time. With the Dirty Flag, I store a
						cached world transform and only recalculate it when the flag is false,
						saving a lot of unnecessary recalculations.
					</p>
